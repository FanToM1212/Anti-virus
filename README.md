### anti-virus

This code is a program that scans a directory for viruses.
It takes two pieces of information from the user: the location of the directory to be scanned and the location of a file containing the "signature" of a known virus. 
The user is then asked if they want to perform a "normal" or "quick" scan. The program will then scan the files in the specified directory, compare them to the virus signature, and log the results of the scan in a file in the same directory. 
Before the scan is performed, the program sorts the file names alphabetically.
